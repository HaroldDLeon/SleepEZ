# SleepEZ 

In a city that houses 63,343 homeless people in the municipal shelter system, we need to come up with improved ways of sharing information on available spaces for the needy to sleep during the night, especially those with no direct access to the internet. So how do the homeless, a user base that more likely than not canâ€™t afford a cell phone with internet capabilities, find a shelter to stay the night in? They find it, with SleepEZ.


SleepEZ, designed to help those without access to the internet, is an app found on the ever emerging LinkNYC kiosks found around NYC. The app is created to fetch a users location and point them to the nearest shelter location in their area. The kiosks would also show the number of available beds within a 3 mile radius in a advertisement style ad, like the ones the LinkNYC kiosks already show users. 


We created this app in the hopes that we could help more of the homeless have a goodnights sleep.

## Built With
